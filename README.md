# Django for Professionals
This is my repo following the book "Django for Professionals" by William S. Vincent.

"When readers interested in web development ask me what to read next after Python Crash Course, I refer them to Will's books: Django for Beginners, Django for APIs, and Django for Professionals. I highly recommend you check out his work." â€” ERIC MATTHES, author of Python Crash Course
